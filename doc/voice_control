Call Morph Commands Description

SSIM has an opportunity to perform actions via so called 'Call Morph Commands'
They are included in Auto Morph Patterns and start with +88 (0x91 0x88)
Their format is following

    +88XXYY

	+88 .. standart prefix
	XX .. command number
	YY .. command params

These commands are designed to be used with voice controlled phones.

There is currently only one command with following syntax

+88010X - it changes active account into X

X is the account id (account number minus 1) and ranges from 0(first account)
to 7(last account)

Usage: Learn your phone to dial +880101 when you say 'Magic' and it will do so :)
